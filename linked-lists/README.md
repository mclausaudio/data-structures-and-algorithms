# Linked Lists

## Pros
- Fast Insertion (at beginning or end)
- Fast Deletion
- Ordered
- Flexible Size

If we have a large # of items in an dynamic array, and we keep adding it.  we would need excessive overhead costs to continue to copy the array in memory and double the space when it reaches the limit to create a larger array.

## Cons
- Slow Lookup
- More memory


## Primary reason to choose a linked list over an array.
- If we have a large # of items in an dynamic array, and we keep adding it.  we would need excessive overhead costs to continue to copy the array in memory and double the space when it reaches the limit to create a larger array.
- Simplicity and ability to grow and shrink as needed.  
- It's a little weird to work with in your head, keeping track of pointers, but they are pretty light weight and self contained in that they can be flexible as well.
