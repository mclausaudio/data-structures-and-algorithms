Singly
=====
Pros:
- Simple
- Requires Less memory
- Delete and Insert is faster than Doubly
Cons:
- It can't be traversed backwards
- If we ever lose the reference to this.head, the list can be lost in memory forever.

Good to use:
- When you have less memory, or memory is expensive
- Your main goal is you want to do fast insertion or deletion
  - Especially when you have insertion at the front / back of list
- You don't need to do much searching

Doubly
=====
Pros:
- Can be traversed from front or back
  - If you need to delete / insert something close to the end, you can start from the back and traverse inwards.  Singly you have to start at the head.

Cons:
- More complex
- Requires more memory because of extra property "prev"

Good to use:
- When you don't have much limitations on memory
- Good operation for searching for elements, ex searching backwards
